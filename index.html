                <p class="text">After graduating Auburn University in 2015 I decided to move to Japan. While there, I worked as an English instructor and enjoyed an eventful year of teaching and touring the country.
                    Though Japan is an amazing place to live, the draw to continue a career in design pulled me home. Once getting back on my feet in the U.S. I scouted out where next to move and Denver was the city that won.

                <p class="text">Now I am a full time graphic designer where I’m able to use my passion for taking people’s advertisement needs and turning them into successful and exciting designs.
                    I’m glad for my job as a designer but I’ve always had a draw to do more with my creative talents and that’s where the coding bootcamp has come into play. Mixing my graphic
                    design background with my love for computers seemed like a good decision for the next step in my career adventure.
